# IMP-078 — Candidate Requirement 1

> [!warning] Unapproved model interpretation
> The source rule is **Active**, but this is a **Draft candidate statement**, not an independent approved requirement. Its segmentation, wording, duplication and applicability must be reviewed before promotion or new implementation work.

## Candidate obligation

Import is additive.

## Authoritative origin

- [[IMP-078]] — exact source rule and decision origins
- [[IMP-078 - Analysis]] — clause decomposition and current classification
- Source family: `IMP`; semantic role: Import Functional Requirement; source phase `P2`
- This is one of 2 initial segments. It may need further splitting, combining or deduplication.

## Use cases requiring this candidate

- [[Import an Engineering Model]]
- [[Correct or Complete Knowledge]]
- [[Review and Resolve Flagged Model Items]]
- [[Explore Element Relationships]]
- [[Explore Complete Product Context]]

## Logical functions supported

- [[Ingest and Reconcile Engineering Sources]]
- [[Maintain and Improve Model Knowledge]]
- [[Query and Traverse Model Relationships]]

## Existing software architecture candidates

- [[MDSE Importer]]
- [[MDSE Core]]

This is an analysis of responsibilities, **not an approved SysML allocation**.

## Verification relationship

- Proposed case: [[VER-31073 - IMP-078 Rule Verification]]
- Acceptance criteria: must be derived and reviewed individually from the candidate obligation
- Executed result: none established
- Rule conflict / supersession review: required before making this an enforceable acceptance criterion

## Cross-model trace — Importer (Draft)

- Source: [[IMP-078]] and [[IMP-078 - Analysis]].
- Use case: [[Import an Engineering Model]]; function: [[Ingest and Reconcile Engineering Sources]].
- Architecture: [[MDSE Importer]], [[Source Reconciliation Engine]] and [[Managed Vault Update]].
- Verification: [[VER-31073 - IMP-078 Rule Verification]].
- Native typed integration: `imp31140` in [[MDSE Toolset Composition]], draft objective intent; original definition in this note. Source clause 1 remains Draft.
- No independent parser/verification or satisfaction assertion.

## SysML v2

> Candidate SysML definition. Parser acceptance and full native relationship semantics have not been established for this pilot.
